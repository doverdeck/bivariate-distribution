# bivariate-distribution
For my bivariate distribution lab I compared Food expedenditures at home to Household income by graphing it as a scatter plot and seeing how it trended depending on higher values. Overall it seemed that the food expenditure based on did not go up, this could be a cause of with greater income you shop out more at restaurants. Due to the large outliers at the end of the household income spectrum it is hard to come to a conclusion about the other data. It is likely assumed that the people who are not spending their money on either do not have money to buy food or are eating out most of the time. Food expenditure at home could also be affected by how many kids people have which would increase the amount of expedenture near the left end as with greater income you are more likely to have less kids. Because of all these factors as shown through the scatter plot despite having a higher income households do not spend more on groceries and other home food options.
